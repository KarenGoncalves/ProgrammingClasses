## Search for word in text file : `grep`

Searches a text in a file

- `grep word file1`: will print to the screen every line of file1 that contains the word _word_ in it.


- `grep "this is my search" file1`: will print to the screen every line of file1 that contains the phrase _this is my search_ in it. Note that, since there are spaces included in the search, the phrase is surrounded by quotes (simple or double, doesn't matter). 


- `grep -i "this is my search" file1`: same as the search above, except that the option `-i` means "ignore case", so all of the phrases below would match the search:
  - "this is my search"
  - "This Is My Search"
  - "this is MY search"
  - "this is my SEARCH"
  - "tHiS iS mY sEaRcH"
  - "THIS is my search"
  
  
- `grep -v word file1`: the `-v` option REVERSES the search, so the result would be every line of file1 that DOES NOT contain the word _word_ in it. 

If you want to search for many words starting/ending with the same characters, or containing the same characters, you can use search patterns, also known as regular expressions, by adding the option `-e` to grep:

- `grep -e "^\w+\t" file1`: grep will search in file the regular expression in quotes, that means "something at the beginning of a line containing letters, numbers or _ followed by tab:
  - `^` at the start of the line
  - `\w+` any letter, number or _ (underline)
  - `\t` tab (appears as white space)

:::.{callout-note}
MobaxTerm, git bash and the unix shell on the server all use different RegEx. Using wildcards such as \w, \d, \W [no alphanumeric character], etc, doesn't always work because of that. 

A safe way to use RegEx is to create our own wildcards, eg.:

  - [A-Za-z_0-9] instead of \\w
  - [0-9] instead of \\d
  - [^A-Za-z_0-9] instead of \\W.

## `sed 's///'`

You can use SED for many things, but it is very powerful for replacing text, either specific words or Regex, or even using variables. 

The command is given inside quotes (single or double) and is split into three parts with the `/`:

- `'s'` - what we want to do: substitute
- The word or search pattern we are looking for (goes between the first and second `/`)
- What we want to replace the search pattern with (goes between the second and third`/`)
- The end of the command (part after the third slash) may be empty or may include another instruction to sed. `g` means: search (and replace) it everywhere.

Note that sed considers each line of a file separately. 

Let's say we want to work with a DNA sequence and we want to replace the bases:

- If I want to replace `AA` with `NN`: `sed 's/AA/NN/g'`.
- If I want to replace `A`s and `T`s with `W`: `sed -e 's/[AT]/W/g'`
- If I want to put the file name as the sequence name, I can store the file name as a variable and use it in sed: 

```
filename=my_fasta.fa
sed -E "s/>/>$filename /"
# Note that when using a variable inside sed, we need to use double quotes
```

- If I want to replace TATA with TATA 3x (create a repeat in the region): `sed 's/(TATA)/\1\1\1/g'`, where `\1` is a reference to the first pattern saved (put inside parenthesis)
